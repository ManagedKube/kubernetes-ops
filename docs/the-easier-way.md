The easier way
================
This is not exactly the easy way but way easier than [the-manual-way.md](the-manual-way.md).

This methods walks you through how to create the VPC and a Kops cluster via
the scripts we provide instead of using the CLIs manually.  However, if you wanted
to learn what exactly it is doing and we encourage you to go through the [the-manual-way.md](the-manual-way.md)
once sometime.

# Replace all of the S3 buckets used
See [s3 buckets replacement](README.md#setting-up-the-s3-buckets)

# Create VPC

## Run

```
cd ops
./vpc.sh -n dev --create true --dry-run false
```

# VPC ID
From the output of the Terraform run, a VPC ID was outputted in the format of
`vpc-xxxxxxx`.  Copy this ID, you will need to put it into a few places.

The following paths all starts from the root of this repository.

## Terraform environment \_env_defaults file
This file hold default values about this environment.  We are adding in the
VPC ID here because there will be subsequent Terraforms that will use this ID
and place itself into this VPC.  

An example is if we wanted to use an RDS database.  We will put the database
in this VPC and it will need the VPC ID to do that.

File: `./tf-environments/dev/_env_defaults/main.tf`

Update the `vpc_id` variable with the ID.

## Kops values.yaml
This file holds the configuration for our Kops Kubernetes cluster for the `dev`
environment.  We are going to tell Kops to put itself into this VPC.

File: `./clusters/aws/kops/clusters/dev/values.yaml`

Replace the value of `vpc` with the VPC ID.

# Create the Kops Kubernetes cluster

Run:
```
cd clusters/aws/kops
./kops.sh --name dev --create true --dry-run false
```

# Interacting with the new Kubernetes cluster
The Kubernetes cluster that is created is a fully private Kubernetes cluster with
no public IP addresses.  This means that you will have to get to the cluster some
how via a bastion host to be able to interact with it.  During the setup, a
bastion host was created for you. The following steps shows you how to
connect to it and create a tunnel.

```
./kops.sh --name dev --get-bastion true --dry-run false
```

This will return information with a `sshuttle` command on how you can connect
to the remote network.

# Git commit the changes back to the repository
Now that we have made all of our changes, we should commit all of the changes
back to our repository.

See what has changed:
```
git diff
```

Write a commit message:
```
git commit -m 'Launching the dev cluster and updating the VPC IDs' -a
```

Push the changes back into git
```
git push origin master
```

# Deleting

# kops
Delete the kops cluster first

```
./kops.sh --name dev --delete true --dry-run false
```

# VPC
Delete the VPC next

```
cd ops
./vpc.sh -n dev --delete true --dry-run false
```
