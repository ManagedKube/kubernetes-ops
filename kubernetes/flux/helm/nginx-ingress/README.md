# Topology this creates

# Why an external and internal nginx-ingress?
The `internal` is set with to us an internal ELB.  This ELB will have an private
IP address reachable only from your internal network.

The `external` has a public IP address that is reachable from anywhere from
the internet.

Launching both of these will create two setups of the above diagram.  The external
setup is usually for your traffic to your application that you want external
users to be able to access (like your customers).

The internal setup is for internal items which internal users should only have
access to such as employees.  Items like Prometheus monitoring, Grafana, or
any other internal only applications you are running on the cluster.
