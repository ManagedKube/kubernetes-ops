# What is DKIM
Docs: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/ses/latest/dg/send-email-authentication-dkim.html
DomainKeys Identified Mail (DKIM) is an email security standard designed to make sure that an email that claims to have come from a specific domain was indeed authorized by the owner of that domain. It uses public-key cryptography to sign an email with a private key. Recipient servers can then use a public key published to a domain's DNS to verify that parts of the email have not been modified during the transit.


This terraform is configuring an Easy DKIM: SES generates a public-private key pair and automatically adds a DKIM signature to every message that you send from that identity, see Easy DKIM in Amazon SES.

The CNAMEs records outcomes of this terraform can be set up in DNS Managment like cloudflare, namecheap, so on.
